#    When a record has several different links defined for the UI and/and or 
#    the guide, report extra links in a 500 field if this parameter is set.  
#    Otherwise, all the 856 fields are preserved (and reported in the log) 
#    and must be checked and removed by hand later.

#    The 520 fields sometimes have language codes that delimit parts of the
#    content written in different languages.  Code format is like [fi].
#    If this parameter is set, the language codes are substituted by newlines
#    and the content is kept in a single field.

#    If this parameter is set, don't add language code subfield $9 to 520 fields.
#    By default, cataloging language is filled in there (if langsplit_520 is not set).
